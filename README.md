# Machine-Learning-Project

This the Machine Learning Project for my Data Analysis Class

This project handled the prediction of the effectiveness of different organic compounds at removing pharmaceutical pollutants

The features are the type of pharmaceutical tat we wish to remove, and the composition of the biomaterials that are used to remove them. The target for this model is the removal capacity of the biomaterial.

The data was obtained from https://github.com/J4RELY/IGUIDEpharmEDA/tree/main. A project that my professor has worked on in the past.

AI was used to write some of the code and solve errors.

GUI:
The GUI for the prediction was developed using Huggingface and is accessible at the link below.

Ethics:
The ethics analysis for the project are in the following checklists

An error is present in the visual file for the project, this error was a manual interupt of the process by me.

# Machine-Learning-Project

This my Machine Learning Project for my Data Analysis Class


This project handled the prediction of the effectiveness of different organic compounds at removing pharmaceutical pollutants

The data was obtained from https://github.com/J4RELY/IGUIDEpharmEDA/tree/main. A project that my professor has worked on in the past.

AI was used to write some of the code and solve errors. 



Three apps were created for this project. The Links are below:
